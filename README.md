## Install

**1.** Get this project somehow and execute [index.sh](index.sh) with your scripts.

```sh
DIR=$(dirname $0)

git clone git@github.com:iagodahlem/scripts.git &> /dev/null
source $DIR/scripts/index.sh
```

**2.** Now you can use any function or constant available.

log "logging"
bold "bolding"
